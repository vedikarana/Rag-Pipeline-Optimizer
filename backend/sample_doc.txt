        RAG Systems Overview
        
        Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that combines information retrieval 
        with language generation. It works by first retrieving relevant documents from a knowledge 
        base, then using those documents as context for generating responses.
        
        Key components of RAG:
        1. Document Chunking: Breaking documents into smaller pieces (chunks)
        2. Embeddings: Converting text into vector representations
        3. Vector Database: Storing and retrieving similar chunks
        4. Generation: Using an LLM to synthesize answers from retrieved chunks
        
        Common chunk sizes range from 256 to 1024 tokens, with overlap between chunks to 
        maintain context continuity.
